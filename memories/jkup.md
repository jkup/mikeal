In 2016 I was a young JavaScript developer who had just moved to San Francisco. I was making Node.js videos as a side project and really wanted to start a podcast, chatting with all the amazing developers I was meeting in the Bay Area. Mikeal hyped me up to just start it, and even offered to be my first guest!

I went over to his apartment in San Francisco and we recorded [this](https://soundcloud.com/the-web-behind/mikeal-rogers) for the Web Behind podcast in 2016.

He had such infectious energy. I wonder how many projects like mine started just because he overheard someone too nervous to go for it and gave them the kick they really needed.

Thanks for the push, Mikeal.
